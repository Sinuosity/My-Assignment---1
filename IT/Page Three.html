<h3 style="font-size:50px;color:lightskyblue;text-align:left;"><I>My Personality Profile<I></h3>

<p1 style="font-size:30px;color:black;"> My personality profile draws data from three tests outlined below:<br><br>
<b>Personality Test:</b> Myers-Briggs - <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">16 Personalities Test</a><br>
This test through a set of multiple choice questions seeks to ascertain what characteristics I display and thus determine what personality stereotype I align to most. Developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs, this test is seen as an extension of Carl Jung theory of psychological types. Whilst there is intense scrutiny regarding the validity of this framework from a psychological perspective, I believe there a strong value anthropologically, using qualitative data to construct insights and tools that can be used for personal development.

<p2 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;"><b>Emotional Intelligence:</b> <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/quizzes/ei_quiz/take_quiz">Emotional Intelligence Test</a><br>
This test through a set of multiple choice questions response to various facial expressions seeks to ascertain my level of emotional intelligence (EQ). Emotional intelligence is often overlooked in favour for it’s counterpart Intelligence Quotient (IQ). However, I believe neither exists in a vacuum and that you need a combination of both to be deemed truly intelligent.</p2><br><br>

<p3 style="font-size:30px;color:black;"><b>Multiple Intelligences</b> <a href="https://personalitymax.com/personality-test/">Multiple Intelligences Test</a><br>
This test through a set of multiple choice questions seeks to ascertain where my strengths and abilities lie, with a focus my individual learning style and natural capacity to understand subject matter. Multiple intelligence theory disputes the binary notion of intelligence as being simply EQ and IQ. Instead the theory, created by developmental psychologist Howard Gardner, states that we all have natural talents that simply cannot be understood under the binary framework of logical and emotional intelligence.</p3><br><br>

<p4 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;"><b>Myers-Briggs:</b> I am an ENTP – (E – Extrovert N – Intuitive  T – Thinking  P – Perceiving)<br><br>
This is known as ‘the Debater’ personality type. ENTPs are known for their charisma, intellect and energy. They are highly analytical and love to brainstorm, engaging with any and all subject matter that piques their interest. Whilst these are some of the more desirable traits of being an ENTP, there are some areas of their personality that they should be cognisant of.</p4><br><br>

<p5 style="font-size:30px;color:black;">ENTPs can be insensitive and intolerant. This stems from their innate quest for the truth. They have little concern for feelings and emotions, especially if they are deemed as a distraction from the objective. They also can find it hard to focus on a singular topic or project, especially when it comes to implementing it. The joy for an ENTP is the solving an intellectual problem, not implementing the solution.</p5><br><br>

<p6 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;">What does this mean for ENTPs as a team player? If there’s a seemingly insurmountable intellectual challenge an ENTP can be a strong asset. They relish any opportunity to engage with complexity and ambiguity. They make excellent sounds boards and are more concerned about finding the right solution, rather than making themselves look good. When it comes to more mundane or administrative tasks, in order to keep them focused, it is important to encourage them to see how smaller tasks form a key part of the bigger narrative. Linking practical or day to day tasks to theoretical concepts satisfies their quench for knowledge, enabling them to contribute more broadly to the team. ENTPs have no trouble recognising emotion and emotions in person on an intellectual level, but may struggle to feel or empathise strongly with these sentiments. If you are dealing with a emotional or sensitive topic, it is useful to be clear about the situation and outline how it could be effecting people. Clear instructions assist ENTPs in reading the room, as they are prone to over-analysing situations at times. Understanding this helps cultivate a positive and high-performing environment.</p6><br><br>

<p7 style="font-size:30px;color:black;"><b>Emotional Intelligence Test:</b><br>According to the Emotional Intelligence test I have a high EQ, scoring 19 out of 20. This is an especially valuable skill when it comes to team and stakeholder interactions. It enables better, more constructive communication with individuals and is particularly useful in managing any conflict that may arise in the work place. As a member of a team this is useful when balancing personalities than may be prone to clash. Listening and understanding both sides of a situation can help bridge differences to establish a practical, working solution.</p7><br><br>

<p8 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;"><b>Multiple Intelligence Test:</b><br>
My top three intelligences and learning styles are - Kinaesthetic – learning through action;
Musical – learning through music; Linguistic – learning through reading, writing and language. This aligns with what I know about myself – I play multiple sports, sing in classical music in various languages, play the violin and enjoy exploring the English language. <br> What this means in the workplace is that I will learn best by doing rather than being told what to do.</p8><br><br><br><br>

<p9 style="font-size:30px;color:black;"><b>What do these results mean for me?</b><br>Follow through is key. Ensuring I set clear goals when carrying out tasks early in the process offers me structure to fall back on for when things become less interesting. When providing feedback on ideas, be sure to consider the person. Seek opportunities to build and develop long-term focus.<br>
<b>How does if affect how I might interact in a team?</b><br>
Work with the team, not against the team. Once a decision has been made, do everything you can to support it, even if you do not entirely agree with it.<br>
<b>What do these results mean for forming a team?</b>
I find working with people who can maintain long term focus and work in a highly structured way useful, as I tend to fall in line with their practices.
I enjoy working with people who are flexible in their thinking, but above all else are willing to be a team player.
Setting expectations early on will benefit everyone in the group.<br><br>
