<h3 style="font-size:50px;color:lightskyblue;text-align:left;"><I>My Ideal Job<I></h3>

<p2><p2 style="font-size:30px;color:black;">My ideal role is to be a <a href="Cyber Security Technical Officer.pdf">Cyber Security Technical Officer</a>, as an Australian Public Servant within the Royal Australian Navy. <br>
An effective Cyber Security Technical Officer requires a broad range of technical and non-technical skills and knowledge, particularly in cyber and maritime capabilities. Successful candidates need to be able to administer, develop and protect Navy systems and must posses the ability to contribute to the development of naval policy.
They also require the ability to build and maintain strong working relationships with key industry, international and departmental stakeholders.<br> 
The intersection of these different disciplines and skills interests me as I have keen passion in interdisciplinary work. I enjoy communicating complex topics that draw on knowledge from various subject areas. I believe that no discipline exists in a vacuum and that some of the most successful ideas and projects that have changed how we operate come from multidisciplinary work.</p2><br><br>

<p3 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;"> A Cyber Security Technical Officer develops and maintains Australian Navy Cyber Systems to protect our Navy from hostile threats. It ties together expertise in communication, IT and security, to produce and maintain capability that enable the Australian Navy to keep Australian and the Indo-Pacific region safe. They also provide advice on a range of technical matters, assist in strengthening our international partnerships and oversee the education and developments of staff. As such the role requires the following:<br><br>

<p5 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;"><b>What I need to obtain:</b><br><br>
<b>Skills:</b> <br> Whilst I possess a strong set of core skills for this job, through previous and current employment, most my engagement has been with non-technical stakeholders. I believe my current studies can strongly develop my ability to engage with technical stakeholders, enabling me to effectively communicate with skill and influence on matters requiring subject expertise.<br><br>
<b>Qualifications:</b><br>I currently possess a limited range of formal qualifications, rooted in high level or qualitative skills. Whilst these have contributed to who I am and where I am today, I believe attaining a Bachelor of Information Technology from an establishment such as RMIT will allow me to pursue postgraduate study and other technical qualifications. I plan to finish my Bachelor’s Degree, then apply for a Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security Governance and Risk Management from RMIT and postgraduate qualifications in the general subject area of security studies and policy. I believe a combination of these qualifications, plus my current work experience, will enable me to an effective and high performing employee in Cyber Security.<br><br>
<b>Experience:</b><br>I have worked in basic technical roles before and I have a proven ability to work in high pressured environments where what outcomes and success look like are constantly evolving and changing. 
I am hoping that towards the completion of my degree that I would be able gain employment in a field related to what I am currently studying. This would be a key factor in helping me secure roles such as the Cyber Security Technical Officer. <br><br><br><br>
