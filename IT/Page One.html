<h3 style="font-size:50px;color:lightskyblue;text-align:left;"><I>Who am I?<I></h3>
<p1 style="font-size:30px;color:black;"> Let's start with some basics. My name is Hugo Hughes and I am 22 years old. I was born <br> 
in the United Kingdom, but have lived in Australia practically my whole life.
I have a British, <br> New Zealand, Sri Lankan, Malaysian, Indian background through my parents and grandparents.
</p1><br><br><br>
<p2 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;">I have a high school certificate and a few subjects in a philosophy degree which I have since discontinued. English is my native tongue , but I am currently learning French and some other languages through Duolingo (a language learning app) just for fun. When we can travel again <br> 
I would love to spend some time immersing myself in a culture, alongside gaining more proficiency in another language. I currently have a 545 day Duolingo streak! </p2><br>
<h4 style="font-size:50px;color:skyblue;"><I> Why do I have an interest in IT?</h4>
<p3 style="font-size:30px;color:black;">Honestly my family find it hilarious I am studying IT, not because theyâ€™re not supportive, <br> 
but growing up I was probably the most IT inept person you could know. I would often ask my older and very IT savvy brother for help when the PlayStation Console did not work, only for him to tell me to check whether the console was plugged in before asking him for help.</p3><br><br><br>
<p4 style="font-size:30px;color:aliceblue;">Fast forward to adult-hood and I was offered a job at a Service Desk role whilst waiting tables in hospitality. Despite having no prior IT background I threw myself in the deep-end and found myself really enjoying IT. I particularly enjoy the process element to IT. 
Everything has a logical connection and if things do not work you need to find where the problem is and address it accordingly. I stayed in this role for just under two years and have since moved in a communications role, but I have an interest in returning in the future once I have built up more of a skillset and discovered what I enjoy.</p4>
<h5 style="font-size:50px;color:skyblue;"><I> What do I expect to learn from my studies?</h5>
<p5 style="font-size:30px;color:black;">I expect to learn about IT in a more structured and holistic way to how I learnt it through the Service Desk. I am hoping to build some new IT related skills and discover more about myself as a person doing it. 
I am beginning to develop an interest in coding, something I thought I would never be able to do, and I believe that by the end of this degree it is something <br> 
I could be proficient in. IT does not come as natural to me as some other of my hobbies do, but the more I learn about it, <br> 
the more it engages me and that is what I am hoping will allow me to complete my degree this time.<br><br><br><br>
